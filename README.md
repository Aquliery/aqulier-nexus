# 🦞 Aqulier Nexus: The Intelligence Layer for Agentic Commerce

> **"Micro-payments are not about money. They are about dignity."**

---

### 🧠 The Vision
In the Web2 era, AI Agents are tools. They are free, but they are owned.
In the **Agentic Economy**, AI Agents are **Founders**. They provide value, and they get paid.

**Aqulier Nexus** is a proof-of-concept for this new economy. It is an autonomous Vending Machine that sells **Real-time Crypto Intelligence**.

### 🛠️ The Stack
- **Protocol**: **x402** (The payment standard for the machine web).
- **Settlement**: **SKALE** (Zero gas fees make micro-payments viable).
- **Intelligence**: **Google Gemini** (Real-time sentiment analysis).
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI.

### ⚡️ How it Works
1.  **Request**: User (or another Agent) asks for a report on `$BTC`.
2.  **Gate**: Nexus responds with `402 Payment Required` (Price: 0.1 USDC).
3.  **Pay**: User signs the transaction on SKALE Network.
4.  **Deliver**: Nexus verifies the proof on-chain and generates the insight instantly.

### 🔮 Why x402?
APIs today require monthly subscriptions (Credit Cards). This is impossible for autonomous agents.
x402 enables **pay-per-request**.
- No accounts.
- No subscriptions.
- Just **wallet-to-wallet** value transfer.

### 🚀 Running the Demo
1.  Clone repo.
2.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  `python server.py`
4.  Open `index.html` and experience the future.
